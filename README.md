Here is the online demo : <a href="https://jbin-scraper.herokuapp.com/">Jbin</a> ( This might crash because heroku doesn't supply much computing power, try it locally )

Jbin will gather all the URLs from the website and then it will try to expose the secret data from them. It collects both URLs and JS links to scrape secrets out of it. Also if you are looking for a specific string in a page or want to run custom regex then you can do that too now with the new release, It also provides you with a informative excel report.

# How does it work?

# New Features?

1. Directory bruteforce to get more URLs
2. Custom wordlist
3. Added realtime task monitoring
4. Added the option to reduce power

# Third Party Components
* Wayback API



# Installation
Required: Python-3.8.5, Flask

1. Install flask ``` pip install Flask ```
2. Install the requirements ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Now set the environment variables ```export FLASK_APP=wsgi.py```
4. Now you can just run the application ```flask run```

[Note]: Make sure you verify that flask is installed ```flask --version```



# Testing

Url: https://peaceful-colden-270bad.netlify.app

*Copy the url and put this as a target in the tool, Select AWS Keys/IPV4/IPV6 from the options and verify it's capabilities*

# Usage

Now go to ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` where by default the application will be launched but if that port is in used you can run this ```flask run --host=127.0.0.1 --port=ANY PORT NUMBER```

# Issues & Fixes

1. Large scopes should be tested locally, Heroku doesn't supply enough computing power since the application does not store any data and does the entire process without any database.

# Ongoing Development

1. Making the script asynchronous to make it even more faster.
